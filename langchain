This is my code execution has no problem but the problem  is the output. Ill show it below
Input Prompt:  Generated top 10 recurring issues discussed in the calls and the count and also give me the fixes given on the that call if not means give not solved
Response:   **Top 10 Recurring Issues:**
1. **ONT/ONU not linking/registering with OLT (12 instances):**
   - **Fixes:**
     - Verify LCP and ensure it's in the right place.
     - Swap the ONT.
     - Check for outages and add a note to the outage ticket if necessary.
2. **No internet connectivity/No ping (5 instances):**
   - **Fixes:**
     - Reset the ONT and DPU.
     - Check operational state and ensure it's not down.
     - Create a
See the output is not fully completed the llm has working good it has potential problem is in retrieval chain
